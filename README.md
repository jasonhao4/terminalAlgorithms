# terminalAlgorithms

The idea with this one was to create a visual of what happens inside algorithms such as bubble sort, quick sort and insertion sorts. 

Later I think I will try to change this into javascript so it will be easier to see rather than inside the terminal.

Also another idea! Maybe Data Structure and Algorithm professors can utilize a visualization tool for students so when they create these sorts, they can see what happens. 
When I was taking Data Structures and Algorithms, we wrote what happened on the white board.
